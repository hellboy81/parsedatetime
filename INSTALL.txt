parsedatetime uses a standard setup.py install method:

    python setup.py install

This will install parsedatetime into your Python's site-packages
location and make it available for import'ing

Python 3.+ is required now for parsedatetime 1.+

parsedatetime is a pure Python module so it does not require any
compiler build step.

parsedatetime does not depend on any external library/module but
will use the following if available:

    PyICU (which depends on ICU)

Python 2.5 NOTE
    parsedatetime's setup.py uses Setuptools ez_setup.py and as
    such will attempt to contact the Python Package Index site
    to see if a new version of Setuptools is required (or to
    download if you don't have it installed.)
